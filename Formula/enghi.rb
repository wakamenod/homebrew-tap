# Homebrew formula for enghi.
#
# This file is the source of truth, but Homebrew does not read it directly. Copy it to
# `Formula/enghi.rb` in the separate `wakamenod/homebrew-tap` repository.
#
# **Builds from source rather than shipping prebuilt binaries** because:
#   - the formula always passes the sqlite_fts5 build tag, so it cannot be forgotten
#   - no downloaded binaries, so Gatekeeper never quarantines them
#   - a single formula covers both macOS and Linux

      To run enghi in the background:
        brew services start enghi

      Then open http://127.0.0.1:7777/ and visit /guide to get started.
      Configuration lives in ~/.config/enghi/config.toml (defaults apply if absent).
